## Repository Layout

```text
docs/                    Experiment log and data notes
data/submissions/        Submission history snapshot
data/leaderboard/        Public leaderboard snapshot
```

## Data

Download the official competition data through Kaggle:

```bash
kaggle competitions download -c birdclef-2026
```

The training code expects the extracted competition files under a local data root containing files such as:

```text
taxonomy.csv
sample_submission.csv
train_audio/
train_soundscapes/
train_soundscapes_labels.csv
```

Large derived artifacts are intentionally excluded from Git:

- competition audio
- feature caches
- model checkpoints
- Kaggle Dataset upload bundles
- raw temporary kernel outputs

See [docs/DATA.md](docs/DATA.md) for details.

## Experiment Log

The main result log is in [docs/EXPERIMENT_LOG.md](docs/EXPERIMENT_LOG.md).

## Public Notebook Attribution

Several experiments are forks or controlled reruns of public Kaggle notebooks. The relevant source links are documented in the experiment log and preserved in the notebook/kernel metadata where available.
